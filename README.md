# GeAt-Calendar
Shows the Iowa State GeAt department's Seminar Calendar

- simple webscraper of a hardcoded Google Calendar (icalendar, .ical format)
- my first Django project, just too an example for a static page server and changed it a bit
- css and JS are ISU branded (static/css and static/js)
- uses boostrap
- will parse the *summary* part of each VEVENT and pull out speaker name, affiliation, title and the data
- parsing is done in example/views.py
